# News Article Recommendation System

## Overview
The **News Article Recommendation System** is an AI-powered platform that suggests relevant news articles based on user preferences and reading history. The system categorizes articles into 10 categories using keyword extraction from both the content and the headline. 

### How It Works
- üìå **Article Categorization**: Articles are classified into 10 categories using keyword-based classification.
- üìñ **User Interaction Tracking**: When a user reads an article, it is stored as "viewed."
- üëçüëé **Preference Learning**: If a user likes or dislikes an article, their preferences are updated accordingly.
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Using **Llama 3.2**, the system generates 5 recommended articles tailored to the user's interests.
